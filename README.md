# VisionTrack: AI-powered Object Detection System

VisionTrack is an advanced object detection system designed to accurately identify and track objects in real-time video footage. Built using Darknet and YOLOv3, the system achieves high accuracy and speed, making it suitable for various real-world applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and video analytics.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 55.3% mean Average Precision (mAP) on the COCO dataset.
- **Real-time Detection**: Detects objects in live video footage with optimized performance.
- **Robust Visualization**: Highlights detected objects in real-time video feeds, providing clear and interactive visuals.
- **Scalability**: Built with flexibility to handle multiple object categories.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Darknet, a deep learning framework optimized for object detection.
- **Model**: YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection.
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other Python libraries for image processing and visualization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VisionTrack.git
    cd VisionTrack
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed. Then, run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download YOLOv3 Weights**:
    Download the pretrained YOLOv3 weights from the [official Darknet website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) and place them in the `weights` folder.

## Usage

1. **Run Object Detection on Video**:
    ```bash
    python vision_track.py --input path/to/video.mp4 --output path/to/output.mp4
    ```
   Replace `path/to/video.mp4` with the path to your input video and specify where to save the output video.

2. **Real-time Object Detection from Webcam**:
    ```bash
    python vision_track.py --input 0
    ```
   This will open the default webcam and start detecting objects in real-time.

## Project Structure

- `vision_track.py`: Main script for running object detection.
- `weights/`: Folder to store YOLOv3 model weights.
- `config/`: Configuration files for YOLOv3.
- `data/`: Folder for sample videos and images.

## Results

The VisionTrack system achieves high accuracy in object detection, with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 55.3% on the COCO dataset. Sample outputs showcase the system's performance across various object categories.

## Future Improvements

- **Integration with YOLOv4/YOLOv5**: To further improve detection accuracy and speed.
- **Customization for Specific Object Detection Tasks**: Training on custom datasets for specialized applications.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhancing detection speed for real-time applications.
